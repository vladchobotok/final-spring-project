Hospital (Spring Framework)
• The system administrator has access to a list of doctors by category (pediatrician, traumatologist, surgeon, ...) and a list of patients. Implement the ability to sort:
1) patients:
- in alphabetical order;
- by date of birth;
2) doctors:
- in alphabetical order;
- by category;
- by the number of patients.
• The administrator registers patients and doctors in the system and appoints a doctor to the patient.
• The doctor determines the diagnosis, makes appointments to the patient (procedures, medications, operations), which are recorded in the Hospital Card.
• The appointment can be made by a Nurse (procedures, medications) or a Doctor (any appointment).
• The patient can be discharged from the hospital, with a definitive diagnosis.
